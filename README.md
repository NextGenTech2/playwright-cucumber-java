# Playwright BDD Automation Framework

A modern, highly optimized test automation framework built using **Java**, **Playwright**, **Cucumber (BDD)**, **PicoContainer (Dependency Injection)**, and **AssertJ**.

This repository focuses on testing and automating services under the ApexToolHub platform, such as JSON-to-CSV converters, CSV-to-JSON converters, and Epoch Timestamp converters. https://apextoolhub.com

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **BDD with Cucumber**: Expressive scenarios written in Gherkin syntax.
*   **Page Object Model (POM)**: Clean separation of BDD steps and page interaction details (locators, actions).
*   **Playwright Engine**: Ultra-fast execution, auto-waiting, and native headed/headless browser management.
*   **Zero-Hardcoding / Data-Driven**: Scenario payloads and expected output mappings are parameterized and stored as external files (`payloads.json`, `expected_outputs.json`).
*   **PicoContainer DI**: Step definition classes share browser state and page object instances cleanly through constructor Dependency Injection (DI).
*   **Timezone-Portable Epoch Testing**: Dynamically evaluates Epoch date/time values inside the browser instance so that assertions pass flawlessly in any timezone (local, UTC/Jenkins, etc.).
*   **Stealth Mode Browser**: Bypasses bot/automation detection algorithms on search engines.

## 🏛️ Design Patterns

### 1. Page Object Model (POM)
The framework enforces the Page Object Model (POM) pattern to maintain structural separation:
*   **Page Classes** (`src/test/java/com/framework/pages/`): Define and encapsulate the page's locators (e.g., `data-testid`, CSS paths) and actions (`clickTool()`, `enterJsonPayload()`, `uploadFile()`). Step definitions invoke these public methods without direct access to Playwright locators.
*   **Maintainability**: Any changes to UI structure only require modifying the locator definitions in the Page Object class rather than editing BDD step definitions.

### 2. Dependency Injection (DI)
*   Page Object singletons and the Playwright browser context are managed and passed using **PicoContainer** constructor injection, ensuring isolation and clean state sharing.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 📋 Prerequisites
*   Java JDK 17 or higher
*   Apache Maven 3.8+

### 📦 Build the Project
Compile the source code and install required browser binaries:
```bash
mvn clean test-compile
```

### 🧪 Run Tests
Tests can be executed via Maven by specifying the tags configuration in the Test Runner or overriding via CLI:

To run all tests:
```bash
mvn test
```

To run a specific tag (e.g., Epoch converter):
```bash
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@epochConverter"
```

To run the CSV-to-JSON upload test:
```bash
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@csvToJsonUpload"
```

---

## 📊 Reports
After tests complete:
*   Standard HTML Cucumber reports are generated under `target/cucumber-reports.html`.
*   Allure test results are saved in `target/allure-results/`. Generate the Allure report:
    ```bash
    mvn allure:serve
    ```
